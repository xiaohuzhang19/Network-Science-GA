####  Summary of Assignments:

If you are also interested in network science topics and materials, feel free to reach out to me. Below is a high-level summary of the assignments for this class; details can be provided upon request.


### Assignment 1:
Introduction to Network Science and Implementation in Python: shortest path algorithm, distribution of the shortest path lengths in the graph, Bipartite Projects on Github.

### Assignment 2:
a. Assortativity and The Friendship Paradox: Visualize the friendship paradox by plotting the average neighbor degree (averaged across all nodes of degree k) as a function of the node degree k to examine the assortativity of a network and its statistical significance.

b. Power-Law Distributions: Plot the in/out degree distributions with linear log bindings similar to the image shown below:

c. The Small-World Property: Identify whether a graph fits the small-world network based on the simulation of a random network and comparison against empirical data via statistical analysis for key metrics such as diameters and the average shortest path length, etc.

d. Directed Network Motifs.

e. Transitivity and the Average Clustering Coefficient.

### Assignment 3:
Centrality, Modularity, and Community Detection.

a. Apply centrality metrics and core identification algorithms such as eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, and Page rank centrality. Identify the relevant metrics for the network.

b. Community Detection with Zacharyâ€™s Karate Club: Include c-finder, greedy modularity maximization, and Louvain algorithm, and perform performance measurement to identify the best algorithm.

c. LFR Benchmark Graph and Normalized Mutual Information Implementation: Perform benchmarking analysis with NMI for greedy modularity and Louvain algorithms.

d. Community Detection with Real-World Data.

### Assignment 4:
a. Modeling the Pandemic with Outbreak Modeling, Transmission Rate, and Identifying Patient Zero using SI, SIS, SR models.

b. Perform simulations to simulate the outbreak, vary the transmission rate to assess the spread of infection, and obtain the distribution of average endemic size versus beta.

c. Identify the impact of patient zero on the spread of an outbreak.
