####  Summary of Assignments:

###  Assignment 1

Introduction of network science and implementation in Python: shortest path algorithm, distribution of the shortest path lengths in the graph,  Bipartite Projects of Github, 

### Assignment2: 

a. Assortativity and The Friendship Paradox: visualize the friendship paradox by plotting the average neighbor degree (averaged across all nodes of degree k) as a function of the node degree k to examine the assortativity of a network and its statistically signinficance. 

b. Power-Law Distributions: plot the in/out degree distributions with linear log bindings similar to

c.The Small-World Property: identify whether a graph fit for the small world network based on the simulation of random network and comparasion against empirical via statistical analysis for the key metrics such as diameters, and the average shortest path length etc.

d. Directed Network Motifs

e.Transitivity and the Average Clustering Coefficient

#### Assignment 3: 

Centrality, Modularity and Community Detection

a. apply centrality metrics and core identification algorithms such as eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality and Page rank centrality
identify the metrics relvanent to the network. 

b.  Community Detection with Zacharyâ€™s Karate Club including c-finder, greedy modularity maximization and louvain algorithm, and performed the performance measurement to identify the best algorithm 

c. LFR Benchmark graph and normalized mutural information implementation, benchmarking analysis with NMI for greedy modularity and louvain algorithms. 

d. community detection with real world data

### Assignment 4. 

Modeling the pandemic model with outbreak modeling, transmission rate, and identify patient 0 with *SI, SIS, SR* models. 

Performed the simulation to simulate the outbreak, vary the transmission rate to assess the spread of infection, get the distribution of average endemic size versus the beta. 

Identify the impact patient 0 for the spread of an outbreak
